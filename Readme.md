# Application for reading a XML file

There is an XML file that includes products information.
The goal is to implement three tasks for 
1) the number of products
2) the name of the products
3) the spare part of each product which may some product does not have any parts.
   
Each task is implemented using buttons that recover required information related to each task.

The app is implemented using node.js and express.js. For reading an XML file the xml2js is used.

## Usage: 

First, install dependencies in package.json by the following command:

``` npm install ```

Then run the application.

``` node ./app.js ```

because the XML file is too large, it takes more seconds to show the information. So, be patient :).
